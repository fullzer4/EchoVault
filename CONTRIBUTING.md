# Contributing to EchoVault

**Status:** pre-MVP. We’re consolidating API/security design before code lands.

## How to help now
- Open issues to discuss design, threat model, and UX flows.
- Share homelab constraints (CPU/RAM/disk/network) to keep targets realistic.
- Propose test plans and benchmarks (seek p95, HLS cold-start, cache hit ratio).

## Coding standards (to be finalized)
- Rust edition 2024, `clippy` + `rustfmt` on CI.
- Conventional Commits.
- Security-relevant changes must include a brief risk analysis.

We’ll expand this once the MVP branch opens.
